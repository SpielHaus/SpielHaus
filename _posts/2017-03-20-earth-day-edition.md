**Shoutouts** We finally had ideal weather for playing outside the Sunday before last at our Daylight Savings edition of the Spielhaus game afternoon. Many many games of Carcassonne were played.

**You too can host:** If you are interested in hosting a game night with this relatively small, relatively curated batch of people you can shoot us an email with the details and we'll include it in the next newsletter.

**Bring a Friend:** If you have any game loving friends you want to share the love with they can subscribe to this newsletter [here](https://tinyletter.com/the-spiel-haus/).
Events

### Get Psyched! ###
Join us at 30 Otsego for one or all. Feel free to bring friends, games, food or drink. We'll provide light snacks and maybe order dinner delivery if people are still around.

**Getting There:**
If you are taking public transit- the J stops 4 blocks from our house. Alternatively get off at Balboa Park and take the Ocean Street exit.
If you are driving- there is plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood. We'll try to remember to move our car so someone can take the driveway and someone else can park the driveway in.

### Get Ready to Play ###
In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. The diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out! If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win. While not entirely on the Earth Day theme you can still cooperate and save the Earth with a play of Pandemic.
