Hey-o meeples!

**We're Back!** We have returned from our journeys abroad in Germany (home of the EuroGame) and we're excited and ready to start hosting game nights/afternoons once again! You're getting this note now because at some point you were part of the "Hanging with my Meeples" team on Rosterbot. To reduce the complexity of game night hosting We've decided to move from Rosterbot to sending out bi-weekly-ish (of the every other week variety) digests on TinyLetter. We won't be hurt if you unsubscribe.

**New Format:** We are extending the schedule to include not just the original Friday night game nights once a month but also, by popular demand, a weekend board game afternoon. We will link to the 2-3 closest upcoming events in the 'Get Psyched' as well as calling out a featured game for the next upcoming event in the 'Get Ready to Play' section.  Hopefully everyone will get excited about trying something new!

**You too can host:** If you are interested in hosting a game night with this relatively small, relatively curated batch of people you can shoot us an email with the details and we'll include it in the next newsletter.

**Bring a Friend:** If you have any game loving friends you want to share the love with they can subscribe to this newsletter [here](https://tinyletter.com/the-spiel-haus/).
Events

### Get Psyched! ###
We've got 3 board game events on the books. Join us at 30 Otsego for one or all. Feel free to bring friends, games, food or drink. We'll provide light snacks and maybe order dinner delivery if people are still around.

**Getting There:**
If you are taking public transit- the J stops 4 blocks from our house. Alternatively get off at Balboa Park and take the Ocean Street exit.
If you are driving- there is plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood. We'll try to remember to move our car so someone can take the driveway and someone else can park the driveway in.

game of the week

### Get Ready to Play ###
Ticket to Ride Europe Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure where players collect cards of various types of train cars that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities in various countries around the world. The game is easy to learn, can be explained in about 5 minutes, and can be played in about an hour. One of our favorite things about playing Ticket to Ride is that the gameplay moves so quickly it always feels like it's your turn while still allowing players to make carefully crafted decisions. Learn to play from [this quick start rule guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWqKkMKz3E) and try to fit a play in at our [next board game afternoon](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=dmxxdWlpNTc4YzR1c2VscGlxanJmZzhuN2sgYXZlcnkubS5hbmRlcnNvbkBt&tmsrc=avery.m.anderson%40gmail.com).
